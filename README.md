# Specter

Specter – Interaction at a distance and ghostly validation for your
cloud environment.

The initial name of that project was Poltergeist, suggesting interaction
at a distance. That name described the intent of the project back then:
To execute SSH and SCP command to a diverse set of clustered hosts and
remote services. Add to that the usage of high availability clusters and
that initial name make perfect sense.

That need evolve through time. Typically, the maintenance of such
complex ecosystem is a shared responsibility. For any major project,
multiple remote teams on different time zone are involve. Communication
and coordination can be an issue in such setting, resulting in glitches
and hiccups. According to Murphy’s law, one of these days, an issue that
was not supposed to happen will caught you off guard. One way to prevent
this to happen is to proactively validate the environment. Don’t expect
what you don’t inspect.

Specter suggest a menace and the anticipation of danger. It better
describes the intent of this toolset: To automate validation in a highly
distributed and somewhat unstable system.
